The Weather App is a web-based application which shows the weather in real time.

The user may type in the name of a city and they will then get a result of the current weather.

The site has been created with Django 1.11.xx, as well as with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4.

The backend is Python, since Django is a Python-based framework.

It uses Postgresql to store data.

## Features

- Users may register, login, logout.
- Users get informed that they are in their personal profile at the top left corner of the dashboard.

- The user has the option to submit a $5 donation via the donation button.

## Design

The website has been designed with CSS and Bootstrap 4.

Bootstrap's role has been mostly in styling.

Most of the colouring has been created via pure CSS.

The clouds/mountains image on the index page (login/registration page) has been taken from unsplash.com.

## UX

The Weather App has a very untuitive nature.

When the user goes to the home page, he is met with a title and two buttons - Login and Register.

Those are accompanied with a beautiful, clean background of white clouds and white mountain tops.
Inspiration for this type of design has been drawn from the likes of Apple and Tesla, where there is little text and beautiful, high-quality background images.
